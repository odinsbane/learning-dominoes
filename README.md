# learning-dominoes
A basic dominioes game for practicing machine learning.

Currently there are three AI, a RandomAI, BasicAI, and ImprovedAI.

The game can be played. I re-did the dominos and they're incredibly difficult to see. The game should
start at a reasonable size, and the pieces should be made to be reasonably sized pieces.
